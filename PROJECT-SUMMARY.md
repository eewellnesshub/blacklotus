## What Was Done

### 1. Created Vite React TypeScript Project

### 2. Extracted Both Projects
Both zip files have been extracted to:
- `my-combined-project/extracted-projects/expanding-cta-landing/`
- `my-combined-project/extracted-projects/gradient-hero/`

### 3. Installed Dependencies
The following packages were installed:
- `framer-motion` - For animations
- `lucide-react` - For icons
- `@paper-design/shaders-react` - For gradient shaders
- `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` - For utility functions
- `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, `autoprefixer` - For styling

### 4. Created Components

#### GradientBackground Component
- Location: `src/components/GradientBackground.tsx`
- Taken from: `gradient-hero` project
- Displays an animated gradient background using shaders
